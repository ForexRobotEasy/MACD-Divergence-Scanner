This code is a custom MACD Divergence Scanner indicator and an Expert Advisor (EA) for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. It scans the market for bullish and bearish divergences based on the MACD indicator and generates alerts when divergences are detected. The main purpose of this code is to provide traders with a tool to identify potential reversal points in the market.

The MACD Divergence Scanner indicator works by calculating the MACD values for the current bar and the previous bar. It then checks for bullish and bearish divergences by comparing these MACD values. If a divergence is detected, an alert is generated indicating the type of divergence (bullish or bearish) and the symbol and timeframe on which it occurred.

The Expert Advisor part of the code runs the MACD Divergence Scanner indicator on each tick and handles the generation of alerts. It also provides functions for initialization, deinitialization, error handling, exception handling, testing, generating documentation, and displaying a user interface.

To use this code, you need to compile it in MetaEditor and then attach the resulting compiled file (.ex5) to a chart in MT5. Once attached, the indicator will automatically scan for MACD divergences and generate alerts when they are detected.
